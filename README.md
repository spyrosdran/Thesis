## Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks and Efficient and Distributed Training of Neural Networks

ðŸ‘‰ This is my thesis about Sentiment Analysis models and distributed training with Tensorflow. In Thesis.pdf, *which is written in Greek*, you may also find how hardware accelerates the training of a model.

ðŸ¤– I have also created a server application, which you can use to play and experiment with the model. The client's folder contains an HTML file, that you can use to interact with the server.

ðŸ‘‰ Follow the steps below, in order to build a docker container of the server. Use the container to easily start the server. Instructions below:

### Docker Container

To build a Docker Container for the server:

 - Open the server folder in your terminal
 - ```docker build -t sentiment-analysis .```
 - ```docker run -p 5000:5000 sentiment-analysis```
 - Open client's ```index.html``` and you' re ready
